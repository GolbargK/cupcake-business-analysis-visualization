# Data Visualization for a Cupcake Business using Power BI
<div align="justify">
In this project!, I visualized a cupcake company data in the way that the end user is able to get the fastest responses to their questions. The report includes two pages:


* Executive summary page including revenue, profit, average sales, top 10 flavors, customer count which were analyzed by year, region, fulfillment type, and product type.

* Customer detail page including average order size, top 20 customers, top 5 bulk customers, birthday months which were analyzed by year, region, and order size.
